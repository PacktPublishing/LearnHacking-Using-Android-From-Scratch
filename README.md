## About the Video Course
Welcome to this comprehensive course on using Android as a penetration testing tool. You will start as a beginner with no previous knowledge about penetration testing. The course will start with you from scratch, from preparing your Android device and computer, installing the needed apps, and will finish up with examples of real-life scenarios that will give you full control over various computer systems. This course focuses on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. For each attack you will learn how that attack works and then you will learn how to practically launch that attack. This will give you a full understanding of the conditions which allow this attack to be successfully executed, and will help you to detect (and sometimes prevent) this attack from happening. The attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices.
